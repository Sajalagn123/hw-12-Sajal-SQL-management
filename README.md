## Description
I added mulitple functions, including being able to see all employees, their salaries, ids, departments, managers, and roles. In addtiion, I also added the functionality of adding an employee, adding a department, showing all existing departments, and showing all existing roles.

User can now add a role which will display the role name, the salary for the role, and the department id.
