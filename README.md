## Description
I added mulitple functions, including being able to see all employees, their salaries, ids, departments, managers, and roles. In addtiion, I also added the functionality of adding an employee, adding a department, showing all existing departments, and showing all existing roles.

User can now add a role which will display the role name, the salary for the role, and the department id.

User can now update an employee or manager, delete an employee, view employees by their department or manager, and view the total salary of a department.

## Installation 
To install my project, I created a repository for it on Github. After that I cloned the repository onto my desktop. I then copied the folders from my class repository and pasted them into my folder. From there, I opened the assignments into a serperate folder.

## Usage
Users will be able to edit the employees and their roles, departments, managers, and salaries to reflect the current status of the company.

## License
None

## Test
Enter node server.js in the command prompt. User should then be prompted with various options to edit the databases containing the employees.

## Demo
Here is a two part demo walking through how the application works:
